# How to Study in this class

This is a programming intensive course and it's about data science.  This course is designed to help you learn how to program for data science and in the process build general skills in programming and using data to understand the world.
Learning two things at once is more complex.
In this page, I break down two approaches to learning successfully in this course.  

## Why this way?

Learning to program requires iterative practice.
It does not require memorizing all of the specific commands, but instead learning the basic patterns.  
Using reference materials frequently is a built in part of programming, most languages have built in help as a part of the language for this reason.  

```{admonition} Where are your help tools?
In Python and Jupyter notebooks, what help tools do you have?
```

## Learning in class

Programming requires both practical skills and abstract concepts. During class time, we will cover the practical aspects and introduce the basic concepts. You will get to see the basic practical details and real examples of debugging during class sessions.

Each class will open with some time to review what was covered in the last session before adding new material.

To get the most out of class sessions, you should have a laptop with you.  During class you should be following along with Dr. Brown, typing and running the same code. You'll answer questions on Prismia chat, when you do so, you should try running necessary code to answer those questions.  If you encounter errors, share them via prismia chat so that we can see.  


## After class

After class, you should practice with the concepts introduced.  
This means reviewing the notes: both yours from class and the annotated notes posted to the course website.  
When you review the notes, you should be adding comments on tricky aspects of the code and narrative text between code blocks in markdown cells.
While you review your notes and the annotated course notes, you should also read the documentation for new modules, libraries, or functions introduced that day.  

In the annotated notes, there will often be extra questions or ideas on how to extend and practice the concepts.  Try these out.

If you find anything hard to understand or unclear, write it down to bring to class the next day.
