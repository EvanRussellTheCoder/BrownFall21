# Basic Facts

### About this course

Data science exists at the intersection of computer science, statistics, and machine
learning. That means writing programs to access and manipulate data so that it becomes
available for analysis using statistical and machine learning techniques is at the core of
data science. Data scientists use their data and analytical ability to find and interpret rich
data sources; manage large amounts of data despite hardware, software, and bandwidth
constraints; merge data sources; ensure consistency of datasets; create visualizations to
aid in understanding data; build mathematical models using the data; and present and
communicate the data insights/findings.

This course provides a survey of data science. Topics include data driven programming
in Python; data sets, file formats and meta-data; descriptive statistics, data visualization,
and foundations of predictive data modeling and machine learning; accessing web data
and databases; distributed data management. You will work on weekly substantial
programming problems such as accessing data in database and visualize it or build
machine learning models of a given data set.


Basic programming skills (CSC201 or CSC211) are a prerequisite to this course. This course is a prerequisite course to machine learning, where you learn how machine learning algorithms work. In this course, we will start with a very fast review of basic programming ideas, since you've already done that before. We will learn how to *use* machine learning algorithms to do data science, but not how to *build* machine learning algorithms, we'll use packages that implement the algorithms for us.



### About this syllabus

This syllabus is a *living*  document and accessible from BrightSpace, as a pdf for download directly online at [rhodyprog4ds.github.io/BrownFall21/syllabus](https://rhodyprog4ds.github.io/BrownFall21/syllabus/). If you choose to download a copy of it, note that it is only a copy. You can get notification of changes from GitHub by "watching" the [repository](https://github.com/rhodyprog4ds/BrownFall21). You can view the date of changes and exactly what changes were made on the Github [commits](https://github.com/rhodyprog4ds/BrownFall21/commits/main) page.

Creating an [issue on the repository](https://github.com/rhodyprog4ds/BrownFall20/issues) is also a good way to ask questions about anything in the course it will prompt additions and expand the FAQ section.


### About your instructor

Name: Dr. Sarah M Brown
Office hours:  TBA via zoom, link on BrightSpace


Dr. Sarah M Brown is a second year Assistant Professor of Computer Science, who does research on how social context changes machine learning. Dr. Brown earned a PhD in Electrical Engineering from Northeastern University, completed a postdoctoral fellowship at University of California Berkeley, and worked as a postdoctoral research associate at Brown University before joining URI. At Brown University, Dr. Brown taught the Data and Society course for the Master's in Data Science Program. You can learn more about me at my [website](http://sarahmbrown.org/) or my research on my [lab site](https://ml4sts.com/).

You can call me Professor Brown or Dr. Brown, I use she/her pronouns.

The best way to contact me is e-mail or an issue on an assignment repo.

#### For assignment help

- **send in advance, leave time for a response** I check e-mail/github a small number of times per day, during work hours, almost exclusively. You might see me post to this site, post to BrightSpace, or comment on your assignments outside of my normal working hours, but I will not reliably see emails that arrive during those hours. This means that it is important to start assignments early.

#### Using issues

- use issues for content directly related to assignments.  If you push your code to the repository and then open an issue, I can see your code and your question at the same time and download it to run it if I need to debug it
- use issues for questions about this syllabus or class notes. At the top right there's a GitHub logo <i class="fab fa-github"></i> that allows you to open a issue (for a question) or suggest an edit (eg if you think there's a typo or you find an additional helpful resource related to something)

#### For E-email

```{note}
Whether you use CSC or DSP does not matter.

- use e-mail for general inquiries or notifications
- Please include `[CSC310]` or `[DSP310]` in the subject line of your email along with the topic of your message. This is important, because your messages are important, but I also get a lot of e-mail. Consider these a cheat code to my inbox: I have setup a filter that will flag your e-mail if you use one of those in the subject to ensure that I see it.
